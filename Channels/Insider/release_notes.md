Welcome to the April 2019 release of Accessibility Insights for Windows.

### Highlights

  - [GitHub Issue Filing](#github-issue-filing)
  - [Multiple Release Channels](#multiple-release-channels)
  - [Rule Updates](#rule-updates)

#### GitHub Issue Filing

GitHub users can now file issues directly from inside Accessibility Insights for Windows. Bug filing from Azure DevOps is still supported, and you can freely switch between the two.

#### Multiple Release Channels

You can now choose how frequently your client updates:
- The **Production** channel updates every 2-4 weeks
- The **Insider** channel updates every 1-2 weeks
- The **Canary** channel updates multiple times per week

You'll be in the **Production** channel by default, but you can change your channel at any time via the **Settings** page

#### Rule Updates

We have updated several of our accessibility rules based on community feedback.
