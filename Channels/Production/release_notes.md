#### UIAccess Changes

UIAccess is an advancecd security feature that is required in some very specific scenarios, but it was enabled by default.
This led to some user confusion from users who do not need UIAccess to be enabled. To address this, we have disabled
UIAccess by default. It can be enabled by running the UIAccess.cmd script that installs with Accessibility Insights for Windows.

#### Bug Fixes

- Tab stop should highlight the first element right away [#151](https://github.com/Microsoft/accessibility-insights-windows/issues/151)
- Prevent crash that can occur after scope changes [#381](https://github.com/Microsoft/accessibility-insights-windows/issues/381)
- Make the UIAccess status accessible [#388](https://github.com/microsoft/accessibility-insights-windows/pull/388)
- Fix a case where the update dialog was incorrectly being displayed [#394](https://github.com/Microsoft/accessibility-insights-windows/issues/394)
- Fix a repaint issue that occurs when JAWS is running [#379](https://github.com/Microsoft/accessibility-insights-windows/issues/379)

We have updated the following accessibility rule based on community feedback.
