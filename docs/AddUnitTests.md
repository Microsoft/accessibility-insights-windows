## Unit Testing

We use the [MSTest framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.testtools.unittesting?view=mstest-net-1.2.0) to write unit tests.

### Unit Test Setup
Setting up unit tests for an assembly is trivial. 
The steps are:
1. Use Visual Studio to **add a new Unit Test Project** (available as a new project template listed under Visual C#, then Test)
   1. In Visual Studio, right-click on the solution and add a new project.
   2. Select unit tests from the template list.
   3. Name your project consistently with the existing test projects. If your project is Widgets.Stuff, then your test project should be named *Widgets.Stuff**Tests***.
   4. Finish setting up the project by following instructions in the [Readme.md](../src/Readme.md)

2. **Add a unit test class** to the project. Name the class after the class it will be testing--if the class is named *ExplodingWidget*, then the test class should be named *ExplodingWidget**Tests***
    1. In Visual Studio, right-click on the test project and add a new test class.
    2. Rename the test class from UnitTests to the name that matches your class name. So if your class is SuperList, your unit test class should be SuperListTests.

>Hint: if you right-click on a method that you need to test, you'll get a template that does this for you automatically. The only thing it doesn't do is to name the actual test according to what's described in Standards

For each test, add a method like this:

```C#
[TestMethod]
[Timeout (1000)]
public void DefaultDelay_IsFiveSeconds()
{
    ExplodingWidget widget = new ExplodingWidget();
    Assert.AreEqual(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5), widget.Delay);
}
```

The required portions in the above example are:
1. `TestMethod` attribute.
2. The test method be `public void`.


When you build, this test will be built and made available for discovery. As long as `widget.Delay` returns a `TimeSpan` object that corresponds to 5 seconds, the test will pass. If the return value is a different type, or if it has a different value, then `Assert.AreEqual` will return `false`, and the test will fail.<br>

If `widget.Delay` throws an exception, then the exception will be caught by the test framework and the test will also fail. In either case, all other tests will continue to execute, and the aggregate result will be rolled up into the reports that are included as part of the build loop.

The Assert methods also have versions that include messages, for cases where the basic assertion is unclear. For example,<br>

`Assert.IsTrue(dictionary.TryGetValue(key, out string value));` <br>

will just tell you that `TryGetValue` failed, without telling you the key it was looking for. You can easily improve the readability of the output by adding a description:<br>

`Assert.IsTrue(dictionary.TryGetValue(key, out string value, "Couldn't find key: " + key));`

The output will now tell you that `IsTrue` failed, but also why. This is especially handy in cases where your `Assert` statement appears within a loop

### Working with Microsoft Fakes

Please read both sections below before making any changes that involve Microsoft Fakes.

#### Adding a test assembly that requires Fakes

Due to the known issue (overwriting fakes assemblies from different unit tests when they have the same name), all `Fakes` assemblies are generated in a single project (`AccessibilityInsights.Fakes.Prebuild`). 

If you need to add a new `Fake` assembly, please follow the below steps:
1. Add a new fakes file into `AccessibilityInsights.Fakes.Prebuild`. 
2. Build `AccessibilityInsights.Fakes.Prebuild`.
3. Add a project dependency (not project reference) of `AccessibilityInsights.Fakes.Prebuild` into the unit test which needs a new fakes assembly.
4. Add an assembly reference of *.fakes.dll (or exe) in `AccessibilityInsights.Fakes.Prebuild/FakesAssemblies` folder to the unit test.
5. Add `Microsoft.QualityTools.Testing.Fakes.dll` into the assembly reference of the unit test.
6. Any references to Fakes assemblies which are added to any test projects should be conditional on the environment variable `FAKES_SUPPORTED = 1`. See the next section for details.

#### Important: Not all editions of Visual Studio support Fakes

Some of the unit tests in Accessibility Insights For Windows use Microsoft Fakes to replace system calls which are otherwise difficult to mock using standard mocking frameworks. The problem is that certain editions of Visual Studio, like Enterprise, support Fakes. And some, like Community, do not. Because Accessibility Insights is open source, we cannot predict which editions of Visual Studio contributors will have access to. Therefore, we have disabled the use of Fakes by default.

If you have an edition of Visual Studio which supports Fakes and you would like to run the unit tests which require them, add an environment variable to your system named `FAKES_SUPPORTED` and set it equal to `1`. Then, restart Visual Studio.

If you want to add any unit tests which use Fakes into a project, make sure of the following:

1. All Fakes references in the project are conditional on the `FAKES_SUPPORTED` environment variable. For example.<BR/>
`<Reference Include="AccessibilityInsights.Actions.Fakes" Condition="$(FAKES_SUPPORTED) == 1"/>`
2. The FAKES_SUPPORTED preprocessor symbol is defined for the project based on the environment variable. For example,<BR/>
    ```
    <PropertyGroup Condition="$(FAKES_SUPPORTED) == 1">
        <DefineConstants>$(DefineConstants);FAKES_SUPPORTED</DefineConstants>
    </PropertyGroup>
    ```
3. Any code which uses Fakes, including using directives, is placed within a `#if FAKES_SUPPORTED` block, for example,<BR/>
    ```
    #if FAKES_SUPPORTED
    // code using Fakes
    #endif
    ```

**Note:** You will need to perform the edits to the project file in a text editor. You can do this in Visual Studio by doing the following:

1. Right click the project in the solution view and select "Unload project".
2. Right click the project in the solution view and select "Edit [Project name].vcsproj".
3. Make changes to the project file as text.
4. right click the project in the solution view and select "Reload project".

**Note:** If every test in a single file uses Fakes, it is acceptable to compile the file conditionally rather than surrounding the code in a `#if FAKES_SUPPORTED` block. To include/exclude an entire file which uses Fakes, add a condition to the files `Compile` tag in the project file as follows:

`<Compile Include="FileBug\FileBugActionTests.cs" Condition="$(FAKES_SUPPORTED) == 1"/>`

These precautions make it possible for contributors who have editions of Visual Studio which do not support Fakes to still compile and run Accessibility Insights successfully. 

**Note:** All official builds of Accessibility Insights include unit tests which use Fakes. So if you add or change such a test, please make sure it passes before submitting a pull request.
